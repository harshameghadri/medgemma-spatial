    "# Automated Mechanism-of-Action Synthesis from Spatial Transcriptomics Using MedGemma\n",

    "\n",
    "Spatial transcriptomics generates high-dimensional maps of gene expression across tissue sections, revealing the cellular architecture of the tumour microenvironment (TME). Translating these complex quantitative datasets into clinically actionable insights remains a significant bottleneck. We present an automated pipeline that integrates Scanpy/Squidpy spatial analysis with MedGemma — Google DeepMind's medical large language model — to generate mechanism-of-action (MoA) focused pathology reports from 10x Visium data. Our approach introduces: (1) a tissue-agnostic two-tier cell type annotation strategy combining z-score marker panels with selective CellTypist immune classification; (2) uncertainty-aware spatial statistics using bootstrap confidence intervals and permutation-based Moran's I; (3) a QLoRA fine-tuned adapter trained on 140 synthetic expert pathology examples to encourage MoA synthesis over data enumeration. Benchmarking against the base MedGemma 4B-it model shows marked improvements in pathway-specific reasoning, research citation, and therapeutic recommendation across 5 defined quality metrics.\n"

    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Clinical Need\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial transcriptomics platforms (10x Genomics Visium, Visium HD) now allow researchers to measure the transcriptome of thousands of tissue spots simultaneously, while preserving spatial context. In oncology, this enables direct characterisation of the **tumour microenvironment (TME)** — the ecosystem of malignant, immune, stromal, and vascular cells that collectively determine patient prognosis and treatment response.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a critical gap exists: **the analysis pipeline produces dense numerical outputs** (Moran's I autocorrelation scores, cell type fraction matrices, neighbourhood enrichment tables) that require expert interpretation before they can inform clinical or translational decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Current Bottlenecks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expert scarcity**: Computational pathologists who can synthesise spatial data are rare\n",
    "- **Data-to-insight latency**: Typical analysis → report cycle takes days to weeks\n",
    "- **Report quality variability**: Automated summaries tend to enumerate observations rather than synthesise biological mechanisms\n",
    "- **Lack of actionability**: Most automated reports omit therapeutic implications or research context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 What We Address\n",
    "\n",
    "This work asks: *Can a fine-tuned medical LLM, given structured spatial features, produce reports that:\n",
    "1. Identify the dominant **mechanism of action** (signalling pathway, ligand-receptor axis)\n",
    "2. Contextualise findings within **published literature**\n",
    "3. Recommend **evidence-based therapeutic strategies**\n",
    "4. Acknowledge **measurement uncertainty**?*\n"

    "\n",
    "Standard scRNA-seq captures *what* cell types are present; spatial transcriptomics captures *where* they are and *with whom* they are co-localised. This spatial context is biologically critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T cell exclusion** from the tumour core (despite peripheral infiltration) predicts poor immunotherapy response\n",
    "- **TLS formation** (tertiary lymphoid structures) co-localising B cells and T cells correlates with better prognosis\n",

    "Moran's I measures whether a gene's expression is spatially clustered (I → 1), random (I → 0), or dispersed (I → -1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "- High Moran's I (> 0.5): gene defines a spatially coherent domain (tumour nest, immune aggregate)\n",
    "- Moderate (0.25–0.5): partial spatial structure\n",
    "- Low (< 0.2): diffusely expressed, no domain structure\n",
    "\n",

This is consistent with a tumour that has attracted immune surveillance but may be actively suppressing effector T cell function via the TGF-β-mediated exclusion axis or PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoA-focused report generation correctly identifies this pattern and links it to IFN-γ/CXCL9 chemokine gradients as the driver of T cell recruitment, while noting that stromal co-enrichment with immune clusters suggests active TGF-β signalling at the tumour-stroma interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.2 Key Insight from Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant improvement in the fine-tuned model is **research citation frequency**. The base model rarely cites specific studies; the fine-tuned adapter, trained on examples that always include author/year references, produces reports with 1-2 citations in >70% of cases. This is clinically important: citations allow the reading clinician to verify claims independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3 Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Synthetic training data**: The 140 training examples are generated by an LLM, not curated by human pathologists. The fine-tuning teaches style more than domain knowledge.\n",
    "2. **Spot-level annotation**: Visium 55µm spots can contain multiple cell types; our annotation assigns one label per spot, creating positional uncertainty.\n",
    "3. **No H&E image integration**: The current pipeline is text-only; MedGemma's multimodal capabilities are not yet fully utilised.\n",
    "4. **Benchmark is self-referential**: Quality metrics test for the presence of terminology, not factual accuracy.\n"

    "### 11.1 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have demonstrated a complete automated pipeline from raw 10x Visium data to mechanism-of-action focused clinical pathology reports. The key contributions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tissue-agnostic annotation** that works across tissue types without prior knowledge\n",
    "2. **Uncertainty-aware spatial statistics** with bootstrap confidence intervals\n",
    "3. **MoA-focused prompt engineering** with phenotype classification and structured output requirements\n",
    "4. **QLoRA fine-tuning** on 140 synthetic expert examples, improving MoA depth, citations, and therapeutic recommendations\n",
    "5. **5-metric quality benchmark** with GO/NO-GO decision logic for adapter deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is deployed as a Streamlit application on HuggingFace Spaces and is accessible at the link in the repository README.\n",

    "### 11.2 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate H&E image analysis via MedGemma's vision encoder\n",
    "- Curate human-expert-annotated training data for a second-generation fine-tune\n",
    "- Extend to Visium HD (2 µm resolution) and 10x Xenium (subcellular)\n",
    "- Validate report accuracy against pathologist-written gold-standard reports\n",
