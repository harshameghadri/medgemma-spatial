MEDGEMMA V2 SPATIAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
================================================================================

1. PHENOTYPE CLASSIFICATION:
   - This sample MOST resembles a HYBRID IMMUNE INFLAMED phenotype.
   - Confidence level: MODERATE.
   - Support: Entropy = 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]), which falls within the 0.40-0.60 range of hybrid immune inflamed.  The presence of 10 MODERATE signals, although less than the 40-60% interface expected of a HOT TUMOR, suggests some immune interaction.
   - Hybrid features: The presence of both B-cell (CD79A, IGHG1) and macrophage (CD68) markers indicates a mixed infiltrate.

2. SIGNAL STRENGTH ASSESSMENT:
   - Spatial analysis is potentially reliable, given the presence of 10 MODERATE signals.
   - However, the lack of STRONG signals warrants caution.
   - Additional validation: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for key markers (CD8A, GZMA, PRF1) would increase confidence in the classification.

3. STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY:
   - p-values for top spatial patterns are not provided.
   - Confidence intervals for entropy are provided (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]).
   - Spatial entropy is relatively low, suggesting a less organized spatial pattern.

4. COMPARATIVE INSIGHTS:
   - This sample differs from a typical HOT TUMOR in the lack of STRONG immune signals and a lower interface percentage.
   - Unexpected feature: The presence of CD79A and IGHG1 suggests a more prominent B-cell component than typically seen in cold tumors.
   - Absent patterns:  A typical HOT TUMOR would be expected to show a high density of CD8

=== END CONDITIONAL REASONING TASK ===

IF entropy = 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]) THEN tumor exhibits a spatially heterogeneous, but not highly diverse, microenvironment BECAUSE low spatial entropy suggests a less complex, more uniform spatial distribution of immune cells and tumor cells, potentially due to a limited immune response and/or clonal expansion without significant immune modulation.

IF interface percentage = 25-40% THEN the tumor has a moderate immune-tumor interface BECAUSE the presence of an interface, even with a moderate percentage, suggests some degree of immune cell interaction with the tumor, potentially leading to localized immune responses or antigen presentation.
=== END CONDITIONAL REASONING TASK ===
IF spatial entropy = 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]) THEN the tumor microenvironment is spatially homogeneous BECAUSE a low entropy value indicates a relatively uniform spatial distribution of immune cells and tumor cells, potentially reflecting a limited immune response or clonal expansion without significant immune modulation.
IF interface percentage = 25-40% THEN the immune response is localized BECAUSE the presence of an interface suggests localized immune cell interaction with the tumor, which may lead to a more targeted, but potentially less robust, immune response compared to a diffuse, systemic one.
=== END CONDITIONAL REASONING TASK ===
IF spatial entropy = 0
