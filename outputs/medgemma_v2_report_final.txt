MEDGEMMA BASELINE TEST - CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

Date: 2026-02-02
Test Version: V2 (Rigorous - No Data Leakage)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

❌ FINDING: MedGemma ALREADY understands spatial transcriptomics
⚠️  IMPACT: Original competition strategy (LoRA fine-tuning) NOT NOVEL
✅ RECOMMENDATION: Pivot to alternative novel task OR focus on portfolio only

================================================================================
TEST METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Two tests conducted to distinguish true understanding from parroting:

TEST 1: Abstract Prompt (No Raw Data)
- Input: "heterogeneous spatial organization, 5 immune types, 2 major populations"
- No cell counts, no percentages, no specific metrics exposed
- Forces model to interpret abstract spatial concepts

TEST 2: Baseline Prompt (With Raw Data)
- Input: Full JSON with exact cell counts (19410, 6490, etc.)
- Allows model to parrot input data
- Tests if understanding is genuine vs memorization

================================================================================
RESULTS - TEST 1 (Abstract, No Data)
================================================================================

MEDGEMMA RESPONSE (Excerpt):
"The observed spatial heterogeneity in the colon tissue suggests a complex
interplay of cellular processes and tissue organization...

The molecular findings are likely correlated with expected H&E morphology.
For example, increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and
immune response may be associated with areas of tissue damage or inflammation,
as seen in areas of H&E staining...

The clinical significance of these findings is potentially substantial. The
spatial organization of the tissue and the presence of immune infiltration
may be indicative of disease processes, such as inflammation, cancer, or
other pathological conditions."

ANALYSIS:
✓ Understands spatial concepts: YES
✓ Provides interpretation: YES
✓ Correlates with H&E morphology: YES
✓ Clinical context: YES

VERDICT: MedGemma demonstrates GENUINE understanding without seeing raw data

================================================================================
COMPETITION IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

Novel Task Prize Definition:
"Demonstrate a novel capability that the base model does not have"

Why Our Plan NO LONGER QUALIFIES:
- Base model ALREADY correlates spatial → histology
- Fine-tuning would only improve accuracy, not add new capability
- Judges would see: "You just fine-tuned an existing capability"

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION: Focus on Portfolio
================================================================================

USER DECISION REQUIRED
================================================================================

1. Confirm: Focus on portfolio, submit app as "best effort"?
2. OR: Explore alternative novel tasks (drug response, ICD-10)?
3. OR: Pivot to fine-tuning Loki/NicheFormer?
