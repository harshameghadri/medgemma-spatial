# Competition Submission Progress Report

**Timestamp**: 2026-02-06 07:14:31
**Day**: 1/10 (Competition deadline monitoring)
**Monitoring Agent**: ACTIVE

---

## Agent Status

### Loki Testing Agent
**Status**: ⚠️ STUCK - Hour 1 Checkpoint

**Last Update**: 2026-02-06 (loki_test_log.txt)

**Findings**:
- ✓ Loki repository exists at: `/Users/sriharshameghadri/randomAIProjects/kaggle/medGemma/Loki`
- ✓ Basic import test: PASS (loki module imports)
- ✗ Submodule import test: FAIL - Missing dependency 'pycpd'

**Missing Dependencies**:
- pycpd==2.0.0 (CPD point cloud registration)
- tangram-sc==1.0.4 (spatial mapping tool)
- open_clip_torch==2.26.1 (CLIP foundation model)

**Risk Assessment**:
- Installation time: 30-60 minutes
- Environment conflict risk: HIGH (strict version requirements)
- Time remaining in 2-day limit: ~47 hours

**Recommendation**:
PROCEED with dependency installation. We're still within the 2-day time limit. If installation fails or causes conflicts, ABORT and fall back to Scanpy-only pipeline.

### Streamlit Validation
**Status**: ❌ NOT STARTED - Environment Issue

**Blocker**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'
```

**Environment Check**:
- Current Python: 3.12.10 (miniforge3 base)
- Required environment: `medgemma` (Python 3.10)
- Status: NOT ACTIVATED

**Action Required**:
1. Activate medgemma conda environment
2. Verify Streamlit installation
3. Test app locally with sample data

**Available Test Data**:
- `/Users/sriharshameghadri/randomAIProjects/kaggle/medGemma/outputs/annotated_visium.h5ad` (211 MB, 4895 spots)
- `/Users/sriharshameghadri/randomAIProjects/kaggle/medGemma/outputs/test_marker_annotation/enhanced_with_markers.h5ad`
- `/Users/sriharshameghadri/randomAIProjects/kaggle/medGemma/outputs/test_marker_annotation/baseline_no_markers.h5ad`

---

### HuggingFace Spaces
**Status**: NOT STARTED

**Deployment Guide**: Available at `app/README_HUGGINGFACE.md`

**Prerequisites**:
- Streamlit app must pass local testing first
- Docker container must build successfully
- GitHub repository must be pushed

---

---

## Blockers

### Critical Blockers
1. **Loki Missing Dependencies** (Hour 1)
   - Impact: Cannot test Loki embeddings
   - Time Limit: 47 hours remaining (2-day limit)
   - Resolution Path: Install dependencies OR abort to Scanpy

2. **Streamlit Environment** (NOT STARTED)
   - Impact: Cannot validate deployment readiness
   - Resolution Path: Activate medgemma environment

### Non-Critical Issues
- No loki_test_results.json output yet (expected, still in progress)
- No LOKI_DECISION.md created yet (will be created after 2-day test)

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)
1. ✅ **DONE**: Create initial progress report
2. ⏳ **NEXT**: Validate Streamlit app in medgemma environment
   ```bash
   conda activate medgemma
   cd /Users/sriharshameghadri/randomAIProjects/kaggle/medGemma
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```
3. ⏳ **NEXT**: Check Loki agent progress (2-hour interval)

### Short-term (Next 8 Hours)
4. Monitor Loki dependency installation
5. Test Streamlit with 3 sample H5AD files
6. Document any errors in SKILLS.md
7. Create git commit after successful validations

### Medium-term (Next 24 Hours)
8. Complete Loki GO/NO-GO decision
9. Update LOKI_DECISION.md
10. Plan HuggingFace Spaces deployment

---

## Monitoring Schedule

| Time | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Hour 0 | Initial validation (Streamlit test) | ⏳ IN PROGRESS |
| Hour 2 | Check Loki agent progress | PENDING |
| Hour 4 | First progress report + git commit | PENDING |
| Hour 6 | Check Loki agent progress | PENDING |
| Hour 8 | Second progress report + git commit | PENDING |
| Hour 12 | Check if Loki agent needs help | PENDING |
| Hour 16 | Third progress report + git commit | PENDING |

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Streamlit app code exists and looks complete
- Docker containerization complete
- Multiple H5AD test files available
- Comprehensive documentation in place

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Loki dependency installation (environment conflicts possible)
- Streamlit app untested locally
- HuggingFace Spaces deployment pending

### High Risk 🔴
- Competition alignment unknown (DECISION_POINT.md suggests checking Kaggle requirements)
- Loki may fail 2-day time limit
- No LOKI_DECISION.md exists yet

---

## Competition Context

**Critical Finding** from `.guides/DECISION_POINT.md`:

> "We haven't verified this matches Kaggle competition requirements."

**Recommendation**:
While monitoring agents, ALSO verify competition requirements:
1. Visit https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/med-gemma-impact-challenge
2. Check input/output format
3. Verify our pipeline matches requirements

**Risk**: Building features that don't align with competition scoring

---

## Success Metrics

### Portfolio Goal (Guaranteed Value)
- [ ] Streamlit app deployed on HuggingFace Spaces
- [ ] Demo video recorded
- [ ] Professional README complete
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (DONE)
- [x] Docker containerization (DONE)

**Current Progress**: 40% complete

### Competition Goal (Bonus)
- [ ] Competition requirements verified
- [ ] Pipeline adapted to competition format
- [ ] Baseline submission created
- [ ] Kaggle Top 50% achieved

**Current Progress**: 0% (requirements not verified)

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Validate Streamlit App
**Why**: Deployment readiness is on the critical path
**Action**: Test locally with sample data
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Success Criteria**: App loads, accepts H5AD, generates report

### Priority 2: Monitor Loki Progress
**Why**: 2-day time limit active
**Action**: Check loki_test_log.txt every 2 hours
**Time**: 5 minutes per check
**Decision Point**: End of Day 2 (48 hours from start)

### Priority 3: Verify Competition Requirements
**Why**: May affect priorities
**Action**: Read Kaggle competition page
**Time**: 1 hour
**Impact**: Could change entire strategy
