MEDGEMMA V2 SPATIAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
================================================================================

=== SPATIAL SIGNAL QUALITY ===
- STRONG spatial signals: 0 genes (p < 0.001, |I| > 0.3)
  Top genes: None
- MODERATE signals: 10 genes (p < 0.05, |I| > 0.1)
  Top genes: ISG15, C1QA, C1QB, CD52, C1QC, LAPTM5, HSPG2, ANGPTL7, ID3, TNFRSF1B
- WEAK/NONE signals: 21 genes

Spatial entropy: 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277])

CRITICAL: You MUST cite these exact counts in your report:
- 0 STRONG signals
- 10 MODERATE signals

=== REFERENCE PHENOTYPES (for comparison) ===

HOT TUMOR:
  - Interface: 40-60%
  - Entropy: 0.60-0.90
  - Key markers: CD8A, GZMA, PRF1
  - Pattern: High immune infiltration, active T-cell response

COLD TUMOR:
  - Interface: 5-20%
  - Entropy: 0.10-0.30
  - Key markers: CD68, CD163
  - Pattern: Immune excluded, macrophage-dominated

HYBRID IMMUNE INFLAMED:
  - Interface: 25-40%
  - Entropy: 0.40-0.60
  - Key markers: CD79A, IGHG1, CD68
  - Pattern: Mixed B-cell and macrophage infiltration, intermediate response

=== YOUR TASK ===
Answer these specific questions

```
IF spatial entropy = 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]) THEN the tumor microenvironment is spatially homogeneous, BECAUSE the moderate entropy value indicates a lack of significant spatial heterogeneity in the immune cell distribution, suggesting a relatively uniform immune response.

IF the INTERFACE is 25-40% THEN the tumor is a cold tumor, BECAUSE the interface percentage falls within the range typical of cold tumors, indicating a limited immune cell infiltration.

IF the absence of strong signals for CD8A, GZMA, and PRF1 THEN the immune response is weak, BECAUSE the absence of these markers suggests a less robust cytotoxic T cell activity and reduced antigen presentation, indicating a weaker anti-tumor immune response.
