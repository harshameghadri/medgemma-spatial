MEDGEMMA V2 SPATIAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
================================================================================

1. PHENOTYPE CLASSIFICATION (with uncertainty):
   - This sample MOST resembles the HYBRID IMMUNE INFLAMED phenotype.
   - Confidence level: MODERATE.
   - Supporting metrics: Entropy = 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]) and Interface at 25-40% (typical cold tumor: 5-20%).
   - Hybrid features: Presence of both B-cell and macrophage markers.

2. SIGNAL STRENGTH ASSESSMENT:
   - Spatial analysis is potentially reliable, given 0 STRONG and 10 MODERATE signals.
   - Proceeding with deeper analysis is warranted, but with caution.
   - Additional validation: RNA velocity analysis to assess cell turnover rates.

3. STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY:
   - p-values for top spatial patterns are not provided.
   - Confidence intervals are provided for entropy.
   - High uncertainty exists in the interpretation of weak signals.

4. COMPARATIVE INSIGHTS (NOT generic descriptions):
   - This sample differs from typical hot tumor in its lower interface percentage.
   - Unexpected spatial feature: Absence of strong T-cell markers like CD8A or GZMA.
   - Absent spatial patterns: Strong interface signals seen in typical hot tumors.

5. TESTABLE HYPOTHESES:
   - Hypothesis: The reduced interface is due to a lower T-cell infiltration.
   - Validation: Flow cytometry analysis of the sample to quantify T-cell populations.

===
IF entropy = 0.269 (95% CI: [0.260, 0.277]) THEN tumor is spatially homogeneous BECAUSE low entropy indicates lack of microenvironment diversity, consistent with clonal expansion without immune infiltration.
IF presence of CD79A THEN B-cell involvement or antibody production BECAUSE CD79A is a B-cell marker, and its presence suggests B-cell activity or antibody production within the tumor microenvironment.
IF absence of strong T-cell response (high CD8A, GZMA, PRF1) THEN immune evasion BECAUSE the absence of these markers suggests that the tumor microenvironment is suppressing T-cell activity, leading to immune evasion.
