Generate a clinical pathology report for Visium HD spatial transcriptomics analysis of colon cancer tissue.

TISSUE CHARACTERISTICS (interpret these patterns):
- Epithelial architecture: intact
- Immune infiltration: high
- Stromal component: prominent

REPORT TEMPLATE (fill in with biological interpretation):

HISTOLOGICAL COMPOSITION:
[Describe the overall tissue architecture based on epithelial status. What does this suggest about tumor structure?]

IMMUNE MICROENVIRONMENT:
[Characterize the immune infiltration level. What types of immune responses are present? Implications for anti-tumor immunity?]

STROMAL FEATURES:
[Describe the stromal compartment. Is there desmoplasia or vascular remodeling?]

SPATIAL ORGANIZATION:
[Comment on tissue heterogeneity and cellular organization patterns]

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
[Provide brief interpretation of key findings relevant to diagnosis or prognosis]
