You are a computational pathologist analyzing Visium HD spatial transcriptomics data from human colon cancer tissue.

TASK: Generate a concise clinical pathology report (150-200 words) that synthesizes the biological findings.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION:
- Tissue composition shows 2 major cell populations
- Immune infiltration detected with 4 immune cell types present
- Spatial organization: heterogeneous
- Tissue complexity: high diversity

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Describe the predominant tissue architecture and cellular composition
2. Characterize the immune microenvironment and infiltration patterns
3. Comment on spatial organization and tissue heterogeneity
4. Provide brief clinical or biological interpretation
5. Note any unexpected or significant findings

CRITICAL:
- DO NOT list cell type percentages or raw counts
- DO NOT enumerate spatial metrics or statistics
- SYNTHESIZE biological meaning, don't summarize data
- Use domain knowledge to interpret patterns
- Focus on clinical/biological significance
