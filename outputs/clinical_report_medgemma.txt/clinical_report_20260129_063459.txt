SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS CLINICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
================================================================================

Date: 2026-01-29 06:34:59
Analysis Method: 10x Genomics Visium + MedGemma-4b-it
Specimen Type: Breast Cancer Biopsy

REPORT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Clinical Pathology Report**

**Specimen:** Breast Biopsy

**Diagnosis:** The tissue is composed of breast epithelial cells, with a significant proportion of luminal epithelial cells (HR+). A notable presence of plasma cells is also observed.

**Tumor Classification:** The tumor is classified as Luminal Epithelial-like (LE) with a high proportion of hormone receptor positive (HR+) cells. The specific subtype is difficult to definitively determine based on the available data.

**Immune Microenvironment:** The tumor microenvironment is characterized by a significant tumor-immune interface (34.6%). Spatial clustering of immune cells (plasma cells) is observed. The presence of ISG15, C1QA, C1QB, CD52, and C1QC suggests an active immune response.

**Spatial Organization:** The tissue exhibits moderate spatial heterogeneity. Spatially variable genes are identified, indicating regional differences in gene expression. Neighborhood enrichment patterns are observed for all cell types, suggesting spatial segregation.

**Clinical Implications:** The presence of a significant immune infiltrate and spatially variable gene expression may influence treatment decisions. Further investigation into the specific immune cell populations and their interactions with tumor cells is warranted.

**Analytical Limitations:** The median cell type confidence of 0.46 indicates potential for misclassification of cell types. The limited number of analyzed spots may not fully capture the spatial complexity of the tumor microenvironment.

**Explanation of choices and considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis and Tumor Classification:** The report starts with a clear diagnosis of breast epithelial cells with a significant proportion of HR+ cells. The subtype is classified as LE with a high proportion of HR+ cells. The difficulty in definitively determining the subtype is acknowledged.
